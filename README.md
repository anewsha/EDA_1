## Introduction
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for tumor diagnosis data using Seaborn, a powerful Python data visualization library. EDA is crucial in understanding the underlying patterns, correlations, and distributions in the dataset, which can aid in building effective machine learning models for tumor diagnosis.

### Steps:
Task 1: Loading Libraries and Data

Task 2: Separate Target from Features

Task 3: Plot Diagnosis Distributions

Task 4: Visualizing Standardized Data with Seaborn

Task 5: Violin Plots and Box Plots

Task 6: Using Joint Plots for Feature Comparison

Task 7: Observing the Distribution of Values and their Variance with Swarm Plots

Task 8: Observing all Pair-wise Correlations
